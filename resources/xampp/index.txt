XAMPP (as of XAMPP v. 1.7.4) for Windows

For best, easiest results, install XAMPP on a USB drive; XAMPP unzips to about 500MB, so use a 1GB or larger drive.

Windows 7:

--Download either the ZIP or the 7zip archive; NOT the installer. (7zip archive is smaller, so it downloads faster; but it may take longer to unzip, up to 10 or 15 minutes, depending on the speed of your computer).

--Copy the unzipped xampp/ folder to the root of your drive (e.g., not in a sub-folder). If your unzipping program has created a folder with xampp/ inside of it (e.g., xampp-win32-1.7.4-VC6/), move just the xampp/ folder to your drive. Depending on the speed of your USB drive, that, too, make take a little while, too (15 or 20 minutes).

**Firewall notes: On the Windows 7 installation that these instructions were written in (which was a regular user account without administrative rights), hitting Cancel on the Windows Firewall warnings did not interfere with accessing the default XAMPP installation at http://localhost/. Hit cancel, and try http://localhost/ in your browser.

If that fails, you can try modifying the httpd.conf file in xampp/apache/conf/; open httpd.conf in your text editor and find the line that reads Listen 80 (Line 47, as of XAMPP v. 1.7.4); change that line to read Listen 8000. Restart XAMPP, and try to access your XAMPP installation in the browser at http://localhost:8000/ (The little XAMPP console will report that `Apache started [Port 80]`, even if you change the Listen line to 8000, 8080, or another high number.)

Windows XP:

Mac OS X:

As of this writing, there does not appear to be a simple USB drive solution for OS X; you will have to install XAMPP on your Mac, which means that you will need to have administrator rights on your machine.

One alternative, for those working on Macs without administrative access, is to set up a development subdomain on your hosting. E.g., dev.example.com/, where 'example.com' is your domain.

But if you do have administrative access, you can install XAMPP--and follow the instructions for modifying httpd.conf to keep your site in your home directory (instead of the /Applications/XAMPP/ directory).
