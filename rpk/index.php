      <h2>Download Options</h2>
      <p>
        You can download the RPK in a few of different forms; all are in <code>.zip</code> format,
        so <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">you might need 7-zip</a> to open them on
        your computer if it has no archiving program. Here are the three versions used in the book,
        which match the content of the book and will always be available here.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/book/rpk/rpk.zip">rpk.zip</a>: Basic XHTML version of the RPK used throughout
        most of the book (see Chapters 9-19)</li>
        <li><a href="/book/rpk/rpk-php.zip">rpk-php.zip</a>: PHP-based version of the RPK (see
        Chapter 21)</li>
        <li>Coming soon: <a href="/book/rpk/#rpk-wp.zip">rpk-wp.zip</a>: WordPress-theme version of the
        RPK for use with WordPress version 3.1 (see Chapter 22)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each of those versions of the RPK includes version 1.5.1 of <a
        href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> and <a
        href="http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/">SWFObject</a> version 2.2. Consider upgrading
        those as new versions are released. Test your site locally using 
        <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">XAMPP</a> before uploading to
        your live site to make sure that everything works.
      </p>
      <h2>Other Download Options</h2>
      <p>
        Adventurous writer/designers can download <a
        href="/book/rpk/rpk-html5.zip">rpk-html5.zip</a>, which is an HTML5 version of the RPK.
        However, it only changes the DOCTYPE declaration to <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> and
        uses the shorter <code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;</code> to specify the Unicode
        character set. Everything else is essentially the same (in that version) as the basic XHTML
        version of the RPK.
      </p>
      <p>
        For even more adventurous writers/designers, you can <a
        href="http://github.com/karlstolley/rpk">browse and download</a> newer versions of the
        different RPKs at <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>. Those versions may differ from
        whatâ€™s in the book.
