      <h2>Setting up XAMPP</h2>
      <p>
        Web writing and design is best done with a simple Web server that runs on a USB drive or on
        your computer.

      <h2>Setting up XAMPP: General Notes</h2>
      <p>
        Setting up <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/">XAMPP</a> is not terribly difficult or
        time-consuming. It lets you test your website at a special URL,
        <code>http://localhost/</code>, that makes it possible to use root-relative paths, run PHP
        scripts, and do other kinds of things your live website will do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Windows instructions immediately follow; Mac users can <a href="#xampp-osx">jump right to
        the OS X instructions.
      </p>
      <h3 id="xampp-windows">XAMPP Setup: Windows</h3>
      <p>
        These steps have been tested with XAMPP version 1.7.4 on a USB drive on Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7.
        Please <a href="/book/contact/">contact the author</a> if you run into any problems so that
        these instructions can be improved, if necessary.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Download either the ZIP or the 7zip archive of XAMPP for Windows 
          <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html#641">from the XAMPP site</a>;
          <strong>do not download the installer</strong>. The 7zip archive is smaller, so it
          downloads faster; but it may take longer to unzip, up to 10 or 15 minutes, depending on
          the speed of your computer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unzip the ZIP or 7zip archive; if you don’t have an unzipping utility, try 
          <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Copy the unzipped <code>xampp</code> folder to the root of your USB drive (in other words,
          don’t place it inside of another folder). If your unzipping program has created a folder
          that has <code>xampp</code> inside of it (e.g., some unzipping programs will create a
          folder like <code>xampp-win32-1.7.4-VC6/</code>), move just the <code>xampp</code> folder
          to the root of your drive. Depending on the speed of your USB drive, that, too, make take
          a little while, too (15 or 20 minutes).
          <div class="screenshot">
            <img src="/book/media/img/xampp-folder.png" width="400" height="300" alt="Screenshot showing xampp folder in the root of a USB drive" />
            <p>
              Windows XP screenshot of the <code>xampp</code> folder in its proper place: in the
              root of a USB drive (in this case, the USB drive’s letter is F:).
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          Load XAMPP by double-clicking on the <code>xampp</code> folder and finding and then
          double-clicking the <code>xampp-control.exe</code> file. (If you don’t see the
          <code>.exe</code> extension, the file will still work—but you should Google for <em>show
          file extensions</em> and the name of your operating system (Windows 7, Windows Vista,
          Windows XP; see pages 45-47 in the book).
        </li>
        <li>
          Start the Apache web server by clicking the Start button on the XAMPP Control Panel.
          Windows Vista and Windows 7 users may get a warning about Windows Firewall; click Cancel
          on any firewall warning windows that pop up.
          <div class="screenshot">

            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          Test that XAMPP is running properly by going to the URL <code>http://localhost/</code> in
          your browser (type the whole thing, including the <code>http://</code> part; notice
          there’s no www. or .com). You should see the XAMPP welcome screen if all is working
          correctly.
          <div class="screenshot">
           <img src="/book/media/img/xampp-splash.png" width="400" height="300" alt="Screenshot showing the XAMPP splash screen" />
          <p>Windows XP screenshot of the XAMPP splash screen in Firefox.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          Some users may get an error from XAMPP that states another service is using Port 80
          (Skype, for example, is known to use that port.) <strong>If everything is working for you,
          skip to the next step</strong>. If you get an error like that, use your text editor (like
          <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>) to open up the
          <code>httpd.conf</code> file. Go to the <code>xampp</code> folder, then into the
          <code>apache</code> folder, and finally into the <code>conf</code> folder, where you will
          find the the <code>httpd.conf</code> file. Locate the line in the file that reads
          <code>Listen 80</code> using the Find function in your text editor. Around line 37, you
          will find a block of text that looks like:
          <pre class="term">#
# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
# ports, instead of the default. See also the &lt;VirtualHost&gt;
# directive.
#
# Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to 
# prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.
#
#Listen 0.0.0.0:80
#Listen [::]:80
Listen 80

</pre>
          Comment out the line that reads <code>Listen 80</code> by putting a hash (<code>#</code>)
          in front of it; below that line, write your own line that reads <code>Listen 8000</code>.
          This part of your file will now look like:
          <pre class="term">#
# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
# ports, instead of the default. See also the &lt;VirtualHost&gt;
# directive.
#
# Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to 
# prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.
#
#Listen 0.0.0.0:80
#Listen [::]:80
#Listen 80
<strong>Listen 8000</strong>

</pre>
          Start or stop and start Apache from the XAMPP Control Panel. Point your browser to
          <code>http://localhost:8000/</code>, and you should see the XAMPP welcome screen. Remember
          to use <code>http://localhost:8000/</code> instead of <code>http://localhost/</code> when
          you’re developing your site.
        </li>
        <li>
          To develop your own site, you’ll want to rename the existing <code>htdocs</code> folder
          inside of the <code>xampp</code> folder to <code>htdocs-original</code>. (You can rename
          it back if you need, for example, to configure the MySQL database for use with WordPress
          development.) Then create your own new <code>htdocs</code> folder for your site, or
          download, unzip, and copy over the <code>htdocs</code> folder from the <a
          href="/book/rpk/">Rapid Prototyping Kit</a> and get to work on your site. (You might want
          to stop and restart Apache in the XAMPP Control Panel before you start working.)
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3 id="xampp-osx">XAMPP Setup: Mac OS X</h3>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the OS X version of XAMPP will not run on a USB drive; you must have
        administrative rights on any Mac that you wish to install and run XAMPP on. These
        instructions have been tested on OS X Leopard and OS X Snow Leopard using XAMPP version
        1.7.3. Please <a href="/book/contact/">contact the author</a> if you run into any problems
        so that these instructions can be improved, if necessary.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Download XAMPP for Mac OS X (Universal Binary) <a
          href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-macosx.html#849">from the XAMPP site</a>.
          Double-click the installer, and drag the XAMPP folder to your Applications folder. (You
          may have to enter your adminstrative username and/or password).
        </li>
        <li>
          Find the XAMPP Control application, which will be in an <code>XAMPP</code> folder inside
          of your <code>Applications</code> folder. Double-click the XAMPP Control application to
          launch.
        </li>
        <li>
          A little Control window will pop up; click the Start button next to Apache. You will be
          prompted to enter your administrative username and/or password.
          <div class="screenshot">
            <img src="/book/media/img/xampp-control-mac.png" width="205" height="138" alt="Screenshot Mac OS X XAMPP Control window" />
            <p>
              Mac OS X screenshot of the XAMPP Control window, with Apache running.
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          Open your browser to <code>http://localhost/</code>; you should see the XAMPP splash page.
          If you are getting an error about another service using Port 80, see <a
          href="#xampp-mac-error">the end of this document</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now things get a little complex. The <code>Applications</code> folder on a Mac is a
          restricted area of sorts, so it’s important to configure XAMPP to read from an
          <code>htdocs</code> folder than you can write to from your user account easily.
        </li>
        <li>
          Go to your home folder in a Finder window; Look for the little house icon with your
          username next to it, and click on it.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the Finder window, create a new <code>htdocs</code> folder (File &gt; New Folder from
          the Finder menu). Or, download and unzip the <a href="/book/rpk/">Rapid Prototyping
          Kit</a> (RPK) and copy its <code>htdocs</code> folder to your home folder.
        </li>
        <li>
          In your favorite text editor (like 
          <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a>), create a new
          text file and put a little line of text in it, like:
          <pre>Hello there! This is just to test XAMPP.</pre>
          Save the file as <code>hello.txt</code>, inside of the <code>htdocs</code> folder you
          created or moved over from the RPK. The <code>hello.txt</code> will be for testing your
          new XAMPP configuration.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now use your text editor to open the XAMPP <code>httpd.conf</code> file. This contains the
          Apache Web server configuration that XAMPP uses. Go to the <code>Applications</code>
          folder, then <code>XAMPP</code>, then <code>etc</code>; you'll see <code>httpd.conf</code>
          listed there. Open it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you’ve opened the <code>httpd.conf</code> file, you should immediately make a copy of
          it, just in case you make a mistake. Choose File &gt; Save As... in your editor, and save
          the file as <code>httpd.conf.original</code>. You will probably be prompted for your
          administrative username and password.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then, choose File &gt; Save As... <em>again</em> and save as <code>httpd.conf</code>, so
          that you’re back to editing the <code>httpd.conf</code> that XAMPP reads (and not the
          <code>httpd.conf.original</code> file that you can use in an emergency).
        </li>
        <li>
          Now to edit the <code>httpd.conf</code> file. Use the Find function in TextWrangler
          (Search &gt; Find...) and search for the text <code>DocumentRoot</code> (one word, no
          space). TextWrangler should take you to around line 174 of the <code>httpd.conf</code>
          file, where you will see:
          <pre class="term">#
# DocumentRoot: The directory out of which you will serve your
# documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but
# symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.
#
DocumentRoot "/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs"

#</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Comment out the <code>DocumentRoot</code> line that’s there by putting a hash
          (<code>#</code>) in front of it. Then, on the line below the one you comment out, write a
          new DocumentRoot line, replacing <code>yourusername</code> as in the example below with
          your real username on your Mac. The DocumentRoot part of your file should now look like
          this:
          <pre class="term"># DocumentRoot: The directory out of which you will serve your
# documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but
# symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.
#
# DocumentRoot "/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs"
DocumentRoot "/Users/<strong>yourusername</strong>/htdocs"

#</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Next, scroll down a little further (about 30 lines) in the <code>httpd.conf</code>, where
          you will see:
          <pre class="term">#
# This should be changed to whatever you set DocumentRoot to.
#
&lt;Directory "/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs"&gt;
    #
    # Possible values for the Options directive are "None", "All",
    # or any combination of:
    #   Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews
    #
    # Note that "MultiViews" must be named *explicitly* --- "Options All"
    # doesn't give it to you.
    #

</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          As you did with the DocumentRoot line, you’ll comment out the 
          <code>&lt;Directory ...</code> line by inserting a hash (<code>#</code>) in front of it.
          Start a new line below it, following the pattern of the line you commented out, and write
          the same path you did in the DocumentRoot line above. This part of your file should now
          look like:
          <pre class="term">#
# This should be changed to whatever you set DocumentRoot to.
#
# &lt;Directory "/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs"&gt;
&lt;Directory "/Users/<strong>yourusername</strong>/htdocs"&gt;
    #
    # Possible values for the Options directive are "None", "All",
    # or any combination of:
    #   Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews
    #
    # Note that "MultiViews" must be named *explicitly* --- "Options All"
    # doesn't give it to you.
    #

</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Save the file as <code>httpd.conf</code>; you might have to enter your administrative
          username and password again.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now the moment of truth: if you left XAMPP running, stop and then start it again from the
          XAMPP Control window. Point your browser to <code>http://localhost/hello.txt</code>, the
          text file you created; you should see your simple “Hello there! This is just to test
          XAMPP.” message. If you do, go ahead and delete the <code>hello.txt</code> file. You are
          now ready to start building your site, and testing it on a local web server.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>About the Book</h2>
      <img src="/book/media/img/book-thumb.png" height="315" width="232" alt="Cover of How to Design and Write Web Pages Today" />
      <p><em>From the publisher, Greenwood Press</em>: An introduction to standards-based Web design, this book treats creating a website from the point of view of the writer, focusing on writing concerns and how they fit with the technological challenges of the Web. Readers will learn about the reasons for writing on the Web; the challenges of writing there; and the solid, but flexible construction of individual pages. The focus is on building websites that can grow, including sites built around the popular, open-source WordPress blogging system. Rich with examples, the book demonstrates that Web writing and design can be fast and fun—and accomplished without expensive software or sophisticated programming skills.</p>
